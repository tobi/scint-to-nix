# Native build dependencies for gems that need system libraries.
#
# Each key is a gem name; the value is a list of nixpkgs attribute names
# that will be added to nativeBuildInputs when building that gem.
#
# These are only used for gems that have native extensions (ext/extconf.rb).
# Gems that bundle their own C source (e.g. sassc, commonmarker) typically
# don't need entries here.
